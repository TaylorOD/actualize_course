        <h2>
        Ingredients
        </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds peppers of your choosing (a mix of sweet peppers and hot peppers), tops/stems removed, halved</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 cups filtered water</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup, optional</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum, optional (see notes)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
        Instructions
        </h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Combine the peppers, garlic, 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoons of sea salt, apple cider vinegar, and honey or maple syrup, if using, in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers and garlic have softened.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a blender (making sure to leave the cover vent open, but covered with a kitchen towel) and blend until very smooth.</li>
        <li>While the blender is running, sprinkle in the xanthan gum, if using, and blend for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a squeeze bottle and store in the fridge for 2-3 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>
        Notes
        </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>In this recipe, xanthan gum works as an emulsifier, stablizer, and thickener. It is 100% optional. If you choose not to use it, your hot sauce will separate in the fridge. Just give it a good shake each time you go to use it. </li>
        <li>The hot sauce will thicken considerably in the fridge, so keep that in mind as you decide on the consistency while blending. </li>
        <li>Depending on the power of your blender, your hot sauce may be foamy when youâ€™re finished blending. If so, let the hot sauce rest for 15-20 minutes, then scrape off any foam before bottling.</li>
        </ul>
